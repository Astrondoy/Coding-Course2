    I'm doing this because of a 65 hour long <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">coding course</a></strong> during summer .</p>
    <br><p>
      Ok so nevermind that I forgot to do this and it's now November the second, 2022 and I'm only like 5% of the way there so I already hate this.

    This is because of the course just to test it out, put your <strong>Name</strong>, pick a <strong>Color</strong> and choose a <strong>Date</strong> for no reason.
    <p>
      Pay absolutely 0 attention to the <strong>Submit</strong> button, you don't have to worry about it.
    </p>
    <form>
      <input type="text">
      <input type="color">
      <input type="date">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok so the course says to make a different page for inputs but I'll leave this here because why not
